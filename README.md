Hoarder's Ship adds shelves and sockets into your ship, so you can stow away and decorate your ship with any item you come across.
There are sockets for every type of item in the game. Try figuring out what items you can hoard, and doing challenge runs to see how much you can collect in one loop!

Feel free to share your personal best hoards in one loop below.
Make sure to turn off any time-pausing mods/tricks to make it a fair challenge!
