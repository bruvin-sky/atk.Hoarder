Spoilers for basegame and DLC items!

Hoarder's Ship adds shelves and sockets into your ship, so you can stow it away in and decorate your ship with any item you come across.
There are sockets for every type of item in the game. Try figuring out what items there are to hoard, and doing challenge runs and pathing to different planets, to see how much you can collect in one loop!

Feel free to share your personal best hoards in one loop below.
Make sure to turn off any time-pausing mods/tricks to make it a fair challenge!
